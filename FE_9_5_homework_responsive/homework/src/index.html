                        <p class="description description-1">In reality both sides of the Moon see the same amount of sunlight however only one face of the Moon is ever seen from Earth. This is because the Moon rotates around on its own axis in exactly the same time it takes to orbit the
                            Earth, meaning the same side is always facing the Earth. The side facing away from Earth has only been seen by the human eye from spacecraft.</p>

                            rotates, causing high and low tides around the globe.</p>

                            Earth instead of the current 27.3 days.</p>
